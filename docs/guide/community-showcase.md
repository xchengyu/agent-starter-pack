### Bob's Brain
**Repository:** [jeremylongshore/bobs-brain](https://github.com/jeremylongshore/bobs-brain)

A production-grade multi-agent system built entirely with Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK) and Vertex AI Agent Engine. Bob's Brain demonstrates advanced ADK patterns including agent-to-agent (A2A) protocol, comprehensive CI/CD with ARV gates, and Terraform-first infrastructure.

**Key Features:**
- **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Orchestrator (bob) + foreman (iam-senior-adk-devops-lead) + 8 specialist agents
- **A2A Protocol:** Full AgentCard implementation with foreman-worker pattern
- **Hard Mode Rules:** R1-R8 compliance enforcement (ADK-only, drift detection, WIF authentication)
- **CI/CD Excellence:** 8 GitHub Actions workflows with ARV validation gates and multi-stage approvals
- **Documentation:** 141 organized docs including 20+ canonical standards (6767-series) reusable across repos
- **Production Patterns:** Inline source deployment, smoke testing, comprehensive error handling

**Technologies:** ADK, Vertex AI Agent Engine, Cloud Run, Terraform, GitHub Actions (WIF), Firestore
**Deployment:** Agent Engine (inline source) + Cloud Run (A2A gateways + Slack webhook)

This project serves as a reference implementation for production-grade ADK agent departments with enterprise CI/CD practices.
