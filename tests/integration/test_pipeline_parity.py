You are comparing two CI/CD pipeline configurations that should functionally be equivalent:

1. **Cloud Build configuration** (Google Cloud Build YAML)
2. **GitHub Actions configuration** (GitHub Actions workflow YAML)

These are template files that use Jinja2 templating with cookiecutter variables. They should perform the same deployment steps but with different syntax for their respective platforms.

**Pipeline Type**: {pipeline_type}

**Cloud Build Configuration:**
```yaml
{cb_content}
```

**GitHub Actions Configuration:**
```yaml
{gh_content}
```

**Your Task:**
Compare these two pipeline configurations and determine if they are functionally equivalent, accounting for:

1. **Different syntax patterns**:
   - Cloud Build uses `${{_VAR_NAME}}` for substitution variables
   - GitHub Actions uses `${{{{ vars.VAR_NAME }}}}` or `${{{{ secrets.VAR_NAME }}}}`
   - Environment variable handling differs between platforms

2. **Variable equivalences** (treat these as the same):
   - `$PROJECT_ID` (Cloud Build) = `${{{{ vars.CICD_PROJECT_ID }}}}` (GitHub Actions)
   - Both refer to the same project where CI/CD infrastructure runs

3. **Jinja2 templating**: Both files use the same cookiecutter conditionals like:
   - `{{% if cookiecutter.deployment_target == 'cloud_run' %}}`
   - `{{% if cookiecutter.data_ingestion %}}`

   **CRITICAL**: When analyzing conditional logic, compare the SAME conditional branches:
   - For `cloud_run` deployment: Compare cloud_run sections in both files
   - For `agent_engine` deployment: Compare agent_engine sections in both files
   - Do NOT mix values from different conditional branches (e.g., don't compare cloud_run values in one file with agent_engine values in another)

4. **Deployment steps**: The core deployment logic should be the same:
   - Docker build/push steps
   - Cloud Run deployments
   - Agent Engine deployments
   - Data ingestion pipeline steps
   - Load testing
   - Authentication/token handling

5. **Expected platform differences** (IGNORE these - they are acceptable):
   - Authentication methods (Cloud Build uses service account, GitHub Actions uses Workload Identity)
   - Variable access patterns
   - Step organization and naming
   - Environment and concurrency features (GitHub Actions `environment` and `concurrency` fields vs Cloud Build's external configuration)
   - Trigger definitions (GitHub Actions `on:` triggers vs Cloud Build's external trigger configuration)
   - Deployment trigger mechanisms (Cloud Build triggering other builds vs GitHub Actions calling workflows)
   - ID token generation for load testing (Cloud Build uses its default service account, while GitHub Actions impersonates a specific service account)
   - Explicit `PATH` environment variable settings in Cloud Build.

6. **Important differences to FLAG**:
   - Different image push locations/destinations
   - Missing or different deployment steps
   - Different container names or artifact paths
   - Inconsistent environment variables or substitutions
   - Missing environment variables (e.g., DATA_STORE_ID in one pipeline but not the other)

**Response Format:**
Respond with a JSON object containing:
```json
{{
    "are_equivalent": true/false,
    "differences": [
        {{
            "type": "missing_step|extra_step|different_logic|missing_conditional|syntax_difference",
            "description": "Clear description of the difference",
            "severity": "critical|moderate|minor",
            "cloud_build_section": "relevant section from cloud build",
            "github_actions_section": "relevant section from github actions"
        }}
    ]
}}
```

**IMPORTANT**: Focus ONLY on functional differences that would affect deployment behavior.

**IGNORE these specific patterns** (mark as "minor" severity or don't report at all):
- Missing `environment:` or `concurrency:` fields in Cloud Build (these are managed externally)
- Missing `on:` trigger definitions in Cloud Build (triggers are configured externally)
- Authentication step differences (Workload Identity vs service account)
- Different mechanisms for triggering subsequent deployments (gcloud builds triggers vs workflow calls)
- Different ways of passing commit SHA to production deployments (explicit --sha vs implicit inheritance)
- Cloud Build explicitly passing COMMIT_SHA to production triggers while GitHub Actions relies on implicit github.sha access in called workflows
- Cross-project deployment patterns where both platforms push images to CI/CD project but deploy to target project
- Missing substitution variables in Cloud Build that would be provided externally
- Usage of `$PROJECT_ID` vs `${{{{ vars.CICD_PROJECT_ID }}}}` (these refer to the same project)
- Different commit SHA access patterns (COMMIT_SHA environment variable vs github.sha)
- Missing explicit checkout/setup steps in Cloud Build (Cloud Build handles repository access differently)
- Different Python installation methods between platforms
- Usage of `pip install package --user` vs `pip install package` (both are valid installation methods)
- Extra logging or informational steps (like echoing links or build status)
- Steps that appear to be missing but actually exist in the same conditional blocks
- Load test parameter differences if they match within the same deployment target conditional blocks
- Different load test execution environments (Cloud Build using custom Docker images vs GitHub Actions installing dependencies on ubuntu-latest runner)
- Different dependency installation methods for load testing (Cloud Build using custom Docker image with `pip install locust` and `apt-get install google-cloud-cli-cloud-run-proxy` vs GitHub Actions using `pip install locust websockets` and `gcloud components install cloud-run-proxy`)
- Different execution environments for load testing in adk_live agent on cloud_run deployment (Cloud Build custom Docker image vs GitHub Actions runner-based setup)
- Different dependency installation patterns in agent_engine + adk_live load tests (GitHub Actions explicitly installing uv/dependencies before load test vs Cloud Build relying on environment persistence from previous steps)
- Different authentication handling for integration test steps (Cloud Build's service account providing inherent permissions vs GitHub Actions using separate authentication steps)
- Missing explicit authentication/GCP auth steps in Cloud Build for integration tests (Cloud Build runs with a service account that implicitly has necessary permissions, while GitHub Actions requires explicit auth steps)
- Shell variable escaping differences where Cloud Build uses `$$` and GitHub Actions uses `$` (e.g., `$$2` vs `$2`, `$$VAR` vs `$VAR`). Cloud Build preprocesses `$$` to `$` before shell execution, making these functionally equivalent when the resulting command is the same.
- Different uv installation patterns in agent_engine deployment where Cloud Build installs uv in a separate step from where it's used (Cloud Build installs with --user flag which persists across steps via the home directory volume, while GitHub Actions installs in the same job; both approaches are functionally equivalent).

**FLAG these as critical/moderate**:
- Different Docker image push destinations (different projects/registries)
- Missing core deployment steps
- Different container names or service names
- Inconsistent artifact paths
- Missing environment variables (e.g., DATA_STORE_ID in one pipeline but not the other)
